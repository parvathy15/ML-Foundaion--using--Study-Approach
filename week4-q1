Clustering and Similarity
TOTAL POINTS 6
1.Question 1
A country, called Simpleland, has a language with a small vocabulary of just “the”, “on”, “and”, “go”, “round”, “bus”, and “wheels”. For a word count vector with indices ordered as the words appear above, what is the word count vector for a document that simply says “the wheels on the bus go round and round.”
Please enter the vector of counts as follows: If the counts were ["the"=1, “on”=3, "and"=2, "go"=1, "round"=2, "bus"=1, "wheels"=1], enter 1321211.

2.Question 2
In Simpleland, a reader is enjoying a document with a representation: [1 3 2 1 2 1 1]. Which of the following articles would you recommend to this reader next?

[7 0 2 1 0 0 1]


[1 7 0 0 2 0 1]


[1 0 0 0 7 1 2]


[0 2 0 0 7 1 1]

3.Question 3
A corpus in Simpleland has 99 articles. If you pick one article and perform 1-nearest neighbor search to find the closest article to this query article, how many times must you compute the similarity between two articles?

98


98*2 = 196


98/2 = 49


(98)^2


99

4.Question 4
For the TF-IDF representation, does the relative importance of words in a document depend on the base of the logarithm used? For example, take the words "bus" and "wheels" in a particular document. Is the ratio between the TF-IDF values for "bus" and "wheels" different when computed using log base 2 versus log base 10?

Yes


No

5.Question 5
Which of the following statements are true? (Check all that apply):

Deciding whether an email is spam or not spam using the text of the email and some spam / not spam labels is a supervised learning problem.


Dividing emails into two groups based on the text of each email is a supervised learning problem.


If we are performing clustering, we typically assume we either do not have or do not use class labels in training the model.

6.Question 6
Which of the following pictures represents the best k-means solution? (Squares represent observations, plus signs are cluster centers, and colors indicate assignments of observations to cluster centers.)
